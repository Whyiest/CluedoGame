# CluedoGame

## Overview
Welcome to "CluedoGame," a project developed during my second year at ECE. This game is a digital adaptation of the classic board game Cluedo, uniquely themed around the popular Among Us universe. Entirely coded in C++ and utilizing the SFML graphics library, this project blends programming skills with creative design.

## Game Features
- **Among Us Theme**: A creative fusion between the traditional game of Cluedo and the world of Among Us.
- **SFML Graphics**: Uses the SFML library to create a visual and interactive user experience.
- **Deduction Gameplay**: As in classic Cluedo, players solve a mystery by deducing who committed the crime, with what object, and in which room.

## Rules of Cluedo
1. **Objective**: Determine who among the characters has committed the crime, with what object, and in which room.
2. **Gameplay Turns**: Players move around the board, suggesting combinations of character, weapon, and room to gather clues.
3. **Final Accusation**: Once a player thinks they have solved the mystery, they make an accusation. If correct, they win the game; if incorrect, they are eliminated.

1. Clone the repository:
